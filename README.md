This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in R programming involving vector recycling during division. The original code attempts an element-wise division of two columns in a data frame, but due to a misunderstanding of vector recycling rules, it produces an incorrect result. The solution provides the correct approach, showcasing how to achieve true element-wise division.
